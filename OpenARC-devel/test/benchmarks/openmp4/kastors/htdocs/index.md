#KaStORS benchmarks

##What is KaStORS?

The KaStORS benchmark suite has been designed to evaluate the implementation of
the OpenMP dependent task paradigm, introduced as part of the OpenMP 4.0
specification.

You can follow its development through the [KaStORS project](https://gforge.inria.fr/projects/kastors) on the INRIA forge.

A quick presentation of the benchmark kernels can be found in the [KaStORS user guide](README.md).

Performance evaluation of all kernels on two NUMA machines can be found [here](performances.md).

##Citing KaStORS

This work has been described in the paper **Evaluation of the OpenMP dependent tasks with the KASTORS benchmark suite** submitted and accepted at [IWOMP2014](http://portais.fieb.org.br/senai/iwomp2014/).

We will soon provide the corresponding bibtex entry.
