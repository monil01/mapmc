                     SPEC ACCEL Benchmark Description File

Benchmark Name

   370.bt

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Benchmark Author

   Serial C version was developed the Center for Manycore Programming at
   Seoul National University and derived from the serial Fortran versions in
   "NPB3.3-SER" developed by NAS.

   OpenACC version was developed by Rengan Xu & Sunita Chandrasekaran from
   University of Houston.

Benchmark Program General Category

   Block Tridiagonal Solver for 3D PDE

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Benchmark Description

   BT solves a 3D discretization of Naiver-Stokes equation: Ku=r where u and
   r are 5x1 vectors defined at the points of a 3D rectangular grid and K is
   a 7 diagonal block matrix of 5x5 blocks. K = BTx * BTy * BTz where BTx,
   BTy and BTz are block tridiagonal matrices of 5x5 blocks in x, y and z
   directions, respectively. The main iteration loop of BT starts from the
   computation of r (compute_rhs) followed by successive inversion of BTx,
   BTy and BTz (x_solve, y_solve and z_solve) and the result is stored in the
   main variable u.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Input Description

   The input dataset size is comprised of W, A, B classes.

   Test: class W reference data for 24X24X24 grids after 200 time steps,

   Train: class A reference data for 64X64X64 grids after 200 time steps

   Ref: class B reference data for 102X102X102 grids after 200 time steps

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Output Description

   It prints out the 5x1 vector in u.
