Benchmark Description

   The importance of solving partial differential equations (PDE) numerically
   as well as the computationally intensive nature of this class of
   application have made PDE solvers an interesting candidate for
   accelerators. In the benchmark we include a stencil code, representing an
   iterative Jacobi solver of the heat equation on a 3-D structured grid,
   which can also be used as a buliding block for more advanced multi-grid
   PDE solvers. The GPU-optimized version draws from several published works
   on the topic, containing a combination of 2D blocking [Rivera et al.] in
   the X-Y plane, and register-tiling (coarsening) along the Z-direction,
   similar to the one developed by Datta et al. Even with these
   optimizations, the performance limitation is global memory bandwidth for
   current GPU architectures we have tested.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Input Description

   303.ostencil's input is driven wholly from the command line, witch
   specifies the size of the stencil grid to create and the number of
   iterations to perform.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Output Description

   303.ostencil outputs a file containing the final cell values, with one
   line per cell in row-major order.
