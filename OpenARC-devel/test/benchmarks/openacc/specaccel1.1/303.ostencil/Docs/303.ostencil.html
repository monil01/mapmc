<h2>Benchmark Name</h2>
<p>303.ostencil</p>
<hr />

<h2>Benchmark Author</h2>
<p>Li-Wen Chang, John A. Stratton</p>
<p>Ported to OpenACC by Mathew Colgrove</p>
<hr />

<h2>Benchmark Program General Category</h2>
<p>Thermodynamics</p>
<hr />
 
<h2>Benchmark Description</h2>
<p>The importance of solving partial differential equations (PDE) numerically as well as the computationally intensive
nature of this class of application have made PDE solvers an interesting candidate for accelerators. In
the benchmark we include a stencil code, representing an iterative Jacobi solver of the heat equation on a 3-D
structured grid, which can also be used as a buliding block for more advanced multi-grid PDE solvers.
 
The GPU-optimized version draws from several published works on the topic, containing a combination of 2D
blocking [Rivera et al.] in the X-Y plane, and register-tiling (coarsening) along the Z-direction, similar to the one developed by Datta et al. Even with these optimizations, the performance limitation is global memory bandwidth for current
GPU architectures we have tested.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Input Description</h2>
<p>303.ostencil's input is driven wholly from the command line, witch specifies 
the size of the stencil grid to create and the number of iterations to perform.  </p>

<hr />

<h2>Output Description</h2>
<p>303.ostencil outputs a file containing the final cell values, with one line 
per cell in row-major order.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Programming Language</h2>
<p><i>C</i></p>
<hr />

<h2>Threading Model</h2>
<p><i>OpenACC</i></p>
<hr />

<h2>Known portability issues</h2>
<p>None.</p>
