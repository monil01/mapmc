These are bindings for LLVM, providing an object-oriented interface as similar as possible to the C++ bindings for JVM languages.  Underneath, they go through LLVM's C bindings.  They currently bind to the headers and ABI of LLVM 2.8, but work on updating them for LLVM 3.0 is underway. 

To compile jllvm, run:
$ ant build

To package jllvm into a JAR file usable as a library, run:
$ ant build
$ ant jar

Happy hacking!
